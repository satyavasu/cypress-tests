- _**fixures**_: fixtures are used as external pieces of static data that can be used by your tests. Read more [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Fixture-Files)

- _**support**_: By default Cypress will automatically include the support file cypress/support/index.js. This file runs before every single spec file.
- _**e2e**_: e2e folder contains the actual tests.
- _**reports**_: By default mochawesome reports will store into report folder.

## Cypress custom commands
This project also adds several custom commands in [cypress/support/commands.js](cypress/support/commands.js). They are useful to reduce the duplicate code.

Example of commands 
```js
    #add Printed Summer Dress product to bag
    cy.clickOnProduct('Printed Summer Dress')

    #select size M
    cy.selectSize('M')

    #add to bag
    cy.addToBag()

    #check number of items in cart
    cy.cartItemCount(3)

```

## Working with XHR

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests.html

Sample Code -

```js
    cy.intercept('POST', '/index.php?rand=*').as('xhr')
```

- cy.intercept is used to control the behavior of HTTP requests.

  - Default method is GET
  - specify endpoint to be tested
  - Create an alias and use it for subsequent tests

## Reports

- Using mochawesome to get the tests report in html format.
